# School_District_Analysis
Maria has been working with the PyCity School District to analyze a data set of testing results for the high schools. Maria has reached out for help with providing a breakdown of the data to provide to the school board. After the inital analysis of the data, the school board requested further information because they were notified of academic dishonesty.

## Overview of Analysis
I was tasked with further analyzing the data by replacing the math and reading scores for Thomas High School with NaNs while maintaing the remaining data. The 1st task was to replace the 9th grade reading and math scores specifically for Thomas High School. Once this task was completedd I then had to re-run the district analysis and provide an updated summary for the district, school, by subject, and grade level. 

## Results 
After replacing the math scores  I was able to determine the number of NaNs to be 461.  Then further analyze specifically for THS.  I was able to determine that there were 1,094 students passing math at a rate of 93% and 1,139 students passing reading at a rate of 97% at THS.

I was then able to gather the District Summary which showed an average passing math score of 75% and passing reading score of 86%

After gathering the district information I created a dataframe to show per school.

## Summary
With the changes made to the original findings I was able to see that replacing the math scores for THS changes the math percentage from 83% to 93%. There were 461 NaNs that were replaced. THS grade level break down showed where the % changes occured. Maria will be able to take this data back to the school board and present.
